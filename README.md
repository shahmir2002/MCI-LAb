This is a dummy repo for MCI lab. 
For each lab, there is a folder named lab_xx (xx being lab number). 
Each lab folder has src/ and inc/ directories. Your code should go inside these sub directories. 
Once finished with doing a lab, commit your work and push it on e.g. github. 
One comment for each lab is a minimum requirement. Ideally, multiple commits are used.
